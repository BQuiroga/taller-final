			<h3><small>Terms Specifically Related to Our Premium Service</small></h3>
			<p class="text-muted" align="justify">
				For users who have elected to purchase a premium subscription to the Services the following additional terms and conditions shall apply:

Description of the Premium Service. If you are signing up for Fitbit Premium Membership, for your membership fee, Fitbit hereby grants to you a license to use the following features and services solely for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to this Agreement: Fitbit Digital Trainer, Fitbit Benchmarking, Fitbit Custom Trackers, Fitbit Activity, Sleep and Food Reports, advanced Heart Rate Trackers, and unlimited Blood Glucose Trackers (together, the Fitbit Premium Services").
Payments. You agree to pay Fitbit the stated fees for the Premium Service for the duration of time and the amount you selected on the sign up page. You permit Fitbit to charge this fee to your credit card and automatically renew the charge for the duration of your membership until you cancel. We use a third party credit card payment processor to process all payments.<br>
Automatic Renewal and Cancellation. Membership fees will be charged to your credit card and will automatically renew at the price then in effect for the duration of your membership until you cancel. Yearly memberships will automatically renew once a year. Cancellation of your membership can be done in the My Account area on Fitbit. If you choose to cancel, your cancellation will take effect at the end of the term in which you cancelled. If your credit card is invalid for any reason, charged back, or if Fitbit does not receive payment, we will cancel your member benefits immediately.
Term. Unless terminated earlier, this Agreement will remain in force as long as you are a paid subscriber to the Premium Services. If you terminate the Service, but continue to be a member of Fitbit, the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy will still apply.<br>
Refund Policy and Termination. If Fitbit cancels the entire Service, you may request a refund in writing within 30 days after the cancellation and receive a refund for the prorated amount of the fees for the Service. If Fitbit makes a material adverse change to the Service or to the terms of this Agreement, you may terminate this Service and request a refund in writing within 15 days of such change and Fitbit will refund the prorated amount of the fees for the Service. If you cancel within 30 days of joining or renewal, you are eligible, upon request, for a full refund. Termination of your Premium Service account and the refund rights above are your sole remedies under this Agreement and against Fitbit in connection with Fitbit's provision of the Premium Service. Because Fitbit reserves the right to alter or discontinue all or any portion of the Premium Service or the Site, you should be sure to retain a copy of any materials you post on the Site and your User data, which can be exported into an Excel or CSV file.<br>
Representations, Warranties and Covenants. You represent, warrant and covenant that (a) the membership and credit card information that you supply is true, correct and complete, (b) you will pay any charges that you incur in connection with the Service, including any applicable taxes, (c) you will update your membership and credit card information as required, (d) you will not allow anyone else to use your membership, (e) you will not transfer your membership or password to anyone else and (f) you will report to us any unauthorized or prohibited use of your membership or this Site.
Amendment. Subject to the termination and refund rights above, you agree that Fitbit reserves the right to amend the Premium Service and the terms associated therewith at any time and for any reason. Any changes may be posted to the Site or sent to you by email or postal mail.<br>
